## About me:
I am working in financial sector for 10 years.

My ideology is *lifelong-learning*, so i am trying to learn something new every time.

1,5 years ago i felt in love in programming, so since that time i've learnt it.

At first i learnt back-end. But i am a person who need to see the visual result.

And now i am here, trying to learn frontend.




## Skills:
* Git
* C (programming language)
* Java (beginning stage)
* Algorithms




## Examples of my code:
This function copy function from library C and it byte-byte compares two memory arrays until n-elements are checked or until different characters are encountered.


```
int	ft_memcmp(const void *s1, const void *s2, size_t n)
{
	unsigned char	*one;
	unsigned char	*two;
	int				count;

	one = (unsigned char *)s1;
	two = (unsigned char *)s2;
	count = 0;
	while (n > 0)
	{
		if (one[count] == two[count])
		{
			n--;
			count++;
		}
		else
			return (one[count] - two[count]);
	}
	return (0);
}
```




## Experience:
I don't have any relevant experience yet.

But i have a lot of projects from studies on C. For example:
+ **Philo**: https://github.com/Xenia80/Phoilo
+ **Libft**: https://github.com/Xenia80/Libft
